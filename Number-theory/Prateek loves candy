Problem Name: Prateek Loves Candy
Problem Difficulty: 1
Problem Constraints: T <= 10000

It is guaranteed that the answer does not exceed 10^6.
Problem Description:
Prateek recently graduated from college. To celebrate, he went to a candy shop and bought all the candies. The total cost was a number upto which there are n prime numbers (starting from 2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Since Prateek wants to minimize his cost, he calls you to help him find the minimum amount that needs to be paid. Being a student of Prateek bhaiya it is now your job to help him out :)



Input Format: First line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases T.
Next T lines contains a single integer N, denoting the number of primes required.
Sample Input: 2
5
1
Output Format: Print the minimum cost that needs to be paid.
Sample Output: 11
2
